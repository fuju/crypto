Write a program that computes the HMAC-SHA256 of two files whose names are passed as parameters from the command line (start from HMAC_computation_EVP).

The flag is obtained as

CRYPTO24{hmac}

where hmac is obtained using the secret "keykeykeykeykeykey" and the two files attached to this challenge (and hexdigits in lowercase):

hmac = hex(HMAC-SHA256("keykeykeykeykeykey", file,file2))

where "keykeykeykeykeykey" is an ASCII string (no quotation marks)
