Write a program in C that, using the OpenSSL library, encrypts the content of a file using a user-selected algorithm.

The input filename is passed as first parameter from the command line, key and IV are the second and third parameter, the output file is the fourth parameter, the algorithm is the last parameter.

The algorithm name must be an OpenSSL-compliant string (e.g., aes-128-cbc or aes-256-ecb). (In short, you have to extend enc4.c)

Look for the proper function here https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.1/man3/EVP_EncryptInit.html

In doing the exercise you have found a very relevant function, build the flag as "CRYPTO24{" + relevantFunctionName + "}"
