You sniffed the following Base64 string

ZZJ+BKJNdpXA2jaX8Zg5ItRola18hi95MG8fA/9RPvg=

You know it is an encrypted payload that has been ciphered with these parameters: key = "0123456789ABCDEF" iv = "0123456789ABCDEF" (Note: key and iv are not to be taken as hex strings)

Write a program (based for instance on dec1.c or a modification of enc4.c) to decrypt it and obtain decryptedcontent.

Then, take note of the following instruction in your decryption program if(!EVP_CipherInit(ctx,algorithm_name(), key, iv, ENCRYPT))

When you succeed, build the flag in this way (Python-style string concatenation)

"CRYPTO24{" + decryptedcontent + algorithm_name + "}"
